This app for Rock Paper Scissors is player functional for 2 players to enter a gameroom and have each wait for a player to join a game. Once both players are connected, each will press a "Start" button to begin app activation to then play the opponent. Game choices are logged in the database. 

They are able to communicate, but I haven't implemented those functions yet. I have made the components that will allow communication, but not the functions that will let you see that happen. It's on the console log currenly.
